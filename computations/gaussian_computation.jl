Solve the joint system for the state and covariance, starting from an initial state x₀ and
covariance Σ₀ at time t₀, until stochastic sensitivity reaches a threshold ν or a time T is reached.
The joint equation is solved via the hybrid Taylor-Heun and Gauss-Legendre method proposed by
Mazzoni.

Arguments:
    state: A vector storing the state, for in-place computations and to store the final state.
    cov: A matrix storing the covariance matrix, for in-place computations and to store the final
         covariance matrix.
    n: The dimension of the state.
    u!: The drift function, which should be inplace and of the form u!(du, u, t).
    ∇u!: The Jacobian of the drift function, which should be inplace and of the form ∇u!(∇u, u, t).
    σσᵀ!: The diffusion function, which should be inplace and of the form σσᵀ!(σσᵀ, u, t).
    x₀: The initial state.
    Σ₀: The initial covariance matrix.
    ts: The vector of temporal gridpoints to use in the solve.

The resulting state and covariance are stored in the destination variables state and covm.
